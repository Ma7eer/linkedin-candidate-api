# linkedin-candidate-api
An RESTful API developed using Directus to store and enable access to linkedin candidate data.

## Key features
- Connect to MySQL DB
- Store linkedin candidate data (Data that can be extracted from a linkedin profile)
- Via an API call, list a specific candidates data
- Via an API call, list all candidate data (No pagination for now)

## Tech used
- Directus (This is what I am exploring)
- MAMP (Set up a DB locally)
- Docker & Docker compose (Run Directus instance that is hosted locally)

## Project purpose
I am building this project to familiarize myself with technologies that are used by my team. This project is meant to be a mini-useful project that can give me a general idea about Directus.
