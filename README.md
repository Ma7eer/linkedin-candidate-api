An RESTful API developed using Directus to store and enable access to linkedin candidate data.

- [x] Via an API call, list all candidate data (No pagination for now)
- [ ] Via an API call, add 1 candidate

## Tech used
- Directus (This is what I am exploring)
- SQLite (Comes with Directus docker conveniently üòÅ)
- Docker & Docker compose (Run Directus instance that is hosted locally)
- Express js (Used to create RESTAPI endpoint)

## Project purpose
I am building this project to familiarize myself with technologies that are used by my team. This project is meant to be a mini-useful project that can give me a general idea about Directus.
